# Aspeed SSIF (SMBus system interface) IPMI BMC interface

The Aspeed AST2500 are commonly used as BMCs (Baseboard Management Controllers)
and the SSIF slave interface can be used to perform in-band IPMI communication
with their host.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be
       "aspeed,ast2500-ssif-bmc"
- reg: I2C address the registers

Example:

       ssif-bmc@10 {
               compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-ssif-bmc";
               reg = <0x10>;
       };
