* Aspeed SSIF IPMI interface

The Aspeed SOC (AST2500) is commonly used as BMCs
(BaseBoard Management Controllers) and the IPMI SSIF interface can be used
to perform in-band IPMI communication with their host.

Required properties:

- compatible : should be
	"aspeed,ast2500-ssif-bmc"
- reg: I2C address the registers

Example:

	ssif-bmc@10 {
		compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-ssif-bmc";
		reg = <0x10>;
	};
